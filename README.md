## Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

- Use [schema_based_on_diagram.sql](./schema.sql) to create all tables.
- Use [data.sql](./data.sql) to populate tables with sample data.
- Check [queries.sql](./queries.sql) for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database
